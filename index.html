	 					<p><strong>Colgate was the first toothpaste in a collapsible tube, introduced in 1896 in New York City. It had been sold in glass jars since 1873.</strong></p>

						<p>It has been in Malaysia since the 1920s. It is in Nepal and India, with manufacturing units based in India and exported to Nepal. While in the Philippines, it was introduced in 1926 under The Palmolive Company Philippines before it changed its name to Colgate-Palmolive Philippines in 1949.</p>

						<p>In 1957, Colgate established its first factory in India to produce toothpaste for the domestic market, and by 1999 became the highest selling brand in the world.[citation needed] Colgate products are marketed in China under its Chinese Brand name 高露洁 (Pinyin: Gāolùjié), which means "high-quality cleaning gel".[citation needed] As of 2002, Colgate occupied 20% of the market share for toothpastes in China. As of 2015, it also commanded approximately 70% of the oral care market in Brazil.</p>

						<p>In 2007, the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK told Colgate that it could no longer make the claim that 4 out of 5 dentists recommended Colgate. Investigation had showed that the study had telephone surveyed dentists to list toothpastes they recommended, and their competitors were recommended at similar rates. The claim was deemed deceptive.</p>

						<p>As of 2015, oral care products (principally produced under the Colgate brand) were the Colgate-Palmolive company's largest source of income, making up around <u>US$7.5 billion, or 47% of net sales globally (with personal care products such as shampoos making up 20%, home care products such as laundry detergents 19% and pet nutrition products making up the remaining 14%)</u></p>
